# Setup Notes from the 11/17/17 run through

## Installation

1. Install Docker, Node, and NPM. Clone this repository.

2. Build the frontend

```
npm install
npx webpack
```

3. Start the backend

```
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Setup the backend's database

```
docker exec -it seriallogger2_web_1 bash
python setup.py
```

5. Open the frontend at `localhost:5000`

## Set up Data Sources

1. Code:

```
"description": "Firmware code on Photon",
"headers": "{\"Authorization\":\"Basic FILLINSECRET==\"}",
"name": "code",
"request_data": "",
"request_type": "GET",
"transform_function": "return sourceData.map(function(c) {             var value = c.commit.message + '\\r\\n' + c.commit.url;             return {                 'value': value,                 'id': c.sha,                 'timestamp': c.commit.author.date             };           });",
"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jhaip/seriallogger2/commits?sha=master&path=photon"
```

2. Serial data

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/data?source=Serial
```

## Update Code to Photon

`tempSensor2` is the name of the Particle Photon I was using.
`temp_sensor` is the folder of the firmware code to be uploaded.

'''
cd seriallogger2/photon
pfgp tempSensor2 temp_sensor
'''

## Log serial output to `seriallogger2` backend

`logger.py` modified so `REMOTE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api/data';`

```
particle serial monitor | tee >(python logger.py)
```

## Derivative Source

Filter to humidity:

```
var re = /^Humid: ([\d\.]+)%*/;
return sourceData.filter(function(d) {
  return d.value.match(re) !== null;
}).map(function(d) {
  return {
    "id": d.id,
    "timestamp": d.timestamp,
    "value": d.value.match(re)[1]
  };
});
```

## Watch live view of graph!


# Notes:

[ ] Making an annotation broke once but worked the second time.
[ ] Notebook can't display visuals for multiple data sources
[ ] Would like autoscroll to bottom for auto-refreshing data
[ ] Difficult to set up the HTTP sources every time. Make a shortcut for some sources?
[ ] No code editor or test of transform_function when creating a source
[ ] Regex will be common in making derivative sources but regex is hard to get right the first time.
[ ] logger.py needs to be more configurable for different endpoints
[ ] No loading and lots of "hard refresh needed" actions
[ ] Only works with Chrome dev console open?
